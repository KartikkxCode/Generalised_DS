# DataStructureLibrary

DataStructureLibrary is a comprehensive C++ library that provides implementations of commonly used data structures and algorithms, along with an interactive console-based application to demonstrate their functionality. It is designed for students, developers, and professionals to learn, practice, and use standard data structures in C++.
## ðŸ“¦ Features

The library includes implementations of the following data structures and algorithms:

- **Stack**:  
  Operations: Push, Pop, Display, Count  

- **Queue**:  
  Operations: Enqueue, Dequeue, Display, Count  

- **Singly Circular Linked List (SinglyCLL)**:  
  Operations: InsertFirst, InsertLast, InsertAtPos, DeleteFirst, DeleteLast, DeleteAtPos, Display, Count  

- **Doubly Circular Linked List (DoublyCLL)**:  
  Operations: InsertFirst, InsertLast, InsertAtPos, DeleteFirst, DeleteLast, DeleteAtPos, Display, Count  

- **Generic Singly Linked List (SinglyLGen)**:  
  Template-based implementation for any data type  
  Operations: InsertFirst, InsertLast, InsertAtPos, DeleteFirst, DeleteLast, DeleteAtPos, Display, Count  

- **Generic Doubly Linked List (DoublyLGen)**:  
  Template-based implementation for any data type  
  Operations: InsertFirst, InsertLast, InsertAtPos, DeleteFirst, DeleteLast, DeleteAtPos, Display, Count  

- **Binary Search Tree (BST)**:  
  Operations: Insert, Delete, Search, Inorder, Preorder, Postorder  

- **Sorting Algorithms**:  
  BubbleSort, SelectionSort  

- **Searching Algorithms**:  
  LinearSearch, BinarySearch

## ðŸ“¦ Library Design

- Generic templates are used for linked lists and algorithms to allow working with any data type.  
- Object-oriented design is applied for stacks, queues, linked lists, and BST.  
- Interactive console menus allow easy testing of data structures and algorithms.  
- Array-based sorting and searching modules are included for practice and demonstration.
